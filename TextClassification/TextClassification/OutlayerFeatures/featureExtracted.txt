was
having
look
through
couple
of
components
catalogues
when
came
across
range
heat
pumps
intended
for
cooling
For
those
who
have
not
heard
this
effect,
you
put
current
one
these
devices,
and
it
from
side
to
the
other
Reverse
reverse
effect
think
temperature
difference
can
give
an
EMF
as
well
Anyway,
struck
me
that
could
make
nice
cool/hot
box
picnics
with
these,
power
regulator,
thermostat
sinks
The
biggest
device
shift
60W
efficiency
80-90%,
which
ain't
bad
(although
would
flatten
my
car
battery
in
about
half
hour)
So-Called
Cool-Hot
boxes
been
advetised
several
years
recall
Damark
advertising
them
recent
catalog
Problem
units
is
they
do
sh***y
job
keeping
food
cold/warm
peliter
devices
used
just
don't
seem
enough
punch
keep
up
If
want
something
hot,
need
before
box,
end
hours
later
thats
only
moderately
warm
Same
goes
cold
items
Unfortunately
catalogue
didn't
list
anything
more
than
basic
specs
pump
imagine
get
back-EMF
gradient
increases
so,
presumably
its
decreases
increases,
until
eventually
we
steady
state
no
being
consumed
(assuming
leakage)
then
final
between
two
sides
be
set
by
supply
voltage
nothing
lousy
way
control
it)
What
like
know
Are
above
guesses
correct?
open-circuit
thermal
resistance
typical
device?
(I
sure
coolbox
going
too
fast
unplug
You'de
probably
better
off
getting
good
Coleman(tm)
cooler
stocking
on
"blue
ice"
blocks
How
does
actually
work?
It
looks
magic!
Why
use
things
domestic
fridges/freezers?
Not
"punch"
keep/get
cold/hot
Thanks
advance,
